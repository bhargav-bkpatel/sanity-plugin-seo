## Usage in Sanity Studio

      title: 'Seo',
      name: 'seo',
      type: 'seoMetaFields'
    }
  ],
  preview: {
    select: {
      metaTitle: 'seo'
    },
    prepare(selection) {
      const { metaTitle } = selection?.metaTitle || '';
      return {
        title: metaTitle || 'seo',
      };
    }
  }
};
